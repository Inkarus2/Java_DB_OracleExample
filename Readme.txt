example with basic interaction with oracle DB

Architecture is now better but of course not perfect

Interaction is with table:
CREATE TABLE EnergyData (
    id NUMBER GENERATED BY DEFAULT AS IDENTITY PRIMARY KEY,
    meter_id VARCHAR2(50) NOT NULL,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    consumption_kwh NUMBER(10, 2),
    generation_kwh NUMBER(10, 2)
